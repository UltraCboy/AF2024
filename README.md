# Art Fight 2024 Jokers

![AF2024 Preview](https://github.com/UltraCboy/ArtFight2024/blob/main/preview.jpg?raw=true)

This is a collection of 3 modded Jokers and 1 modded deck for Balatro, a roguelike deckbuilder game.
These Jokers were made as attacks against other artists during Art Fight 2024.

## How to Install
- Install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) if you haven't already.
- Download the contents of this repository, either by cloning it or downloading a ZIP file.
  - If you download a ZIP file, make sure to unzip the contents.
- Place the resulting Art Fight 2024 folder in your mods folder.

## Dependencies
- Requires [Steamodded 1.0.0](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) or later.

## Known Issues
- Dotty's starting Tarot card is preset to The Wheel of Fortune. 
  - I had trouble getting it to start on a random Tarot, so this was a temporary solution until that got fixed.
- ??????'s suit highlighting is inconsistent with other Jokers, always highlighting the suit in yellow.
  - There's no easy way to allow standard suit highlighting with special cases for Wild & Stone cards, so this was my workaround.
  - ??????'s effect may be changed entirely at a later point to resolve this issue.
